# ☁ skyline-overlay ☁

A horizon FFXIV ACT overlay built with Vite & Vue 3 Composition API.

It's basically a Vue & customized version of [horizoverlay](https://github.com/bsides/horizoverlay/) and has some of [ikegami](https://github.com/hibiyasleep/ikegami)'s features. The main purpose of building this project is to get familiar with Vue 3 & Composition API, which can also test my [ffxiv-overlay-api](https://github.com/dsrkafuu/ffxiv-overlay-api).
